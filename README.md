# Spelling Bee Hints Generator

## Overview
This is small idiotic utility for those who are struggling with the Spelling Bee of The Times.

It generates hints based on the letters you provide. 

It is kind of dumb to use it though.

As an experiment it was ok.

Note that not all the words are accepted. 

It is using the [GNU CIDE](https://gcide.gnu.org.ua/) Database for words. 


## Usage
`./sbphints.py --must n --extra t c u o i m --hints 5`

## Downloading the dataset
`./get_dataset.sh`
